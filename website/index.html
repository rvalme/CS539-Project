            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p class="">
            Due to a variety of reasons, companies often have to shut down stores. Often times the reason is because the surrounding population does not actually have a need for the company’s services. This occurrence causes huge losses for a company or business as they have spent valuable resources such as time planning and building the store, money paying workers, and product that could have been sold to customers in a more conducive environment. 
            </br></br>
            This tool will help mitigate such losses as it will allow companies to see beforehand whether or not a store may be successful in an area.

            <h2>Benefit</h2>
            <p class="">
            A tool like this would be useful for Starbucks or any other chain franchises to determine possible locations for new stores and currently underperforming stores that could be shut down. Chain franchises employ teams of people whose responsibility is to perform the previously mentioned task.
            </br></br>A location assessor like this would make the employees jobs much easier and at the same time would allow them to focus on the more interesting parts of their jobs like designing the layout of the store and finding the perfect location in the zip code. While our tool would not replace the jobs of these individuals, it would certainly make their lives easier.

            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p class="">Our model will use U.S. census data, which provides the total population, demographic breakup, and household income in conjunction with publicly available datasets of chain franchise locations. The data provided in the U.S census data will be used as input to predict the number of chain franchise locations in a certain zip code.</br></br> Comparing the predicted number of store locations with currently open store locations in a zip code would tell a company
            whether to open or close stores in the area of the zip code. </p>
