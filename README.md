# CS539-Project

To run all of our scripts, you will need to download the 2016_USCensus.csv file from: and keep it in the same directory as our python scripts you want to run.
To run our XGBoost Code, download the xgboost_code_final.py and run it in the console by typing: "python xgboost_code_final.py".
Our script will concatenate the predicted values from XGBoost to the original US Census dataset.
