# CS539-Project

To run all of our scripts, you will need to download our cleaned 2016 US Census data file from: https://www.dropbox.com/s/rh7xojgbkqbt5dh/2017_USCensus_Cleaned.csv?dl=0 and keep it in the same directory as our XGBoost Code.
To run our XGBoost Code, download the xgboost_code_final.py and run it in the console by typing: "python xgboost_code_final.py".
Our script will concatenate the predicted values from XGBoost to the original US Census dataset.

If you are working with uncleaned US Census data and the original Starbucks store list, which can be downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/s/4ltmagcpcsfkbvc/Cleaned_Starbucks_2017.csv?dl=0, download format_data.py and combine_data.py. Put both these files in the same directory as as the uncleaned data files and run them both. These scripts will produce the correct output you need to run the XGBoost Script.
